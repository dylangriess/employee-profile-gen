## Description

> The motivation for this project was making a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
> I built this project to demonstrate how to quickly generate a profile page to have quick access to email and github profiles.
> It solves the issue of having to statically render contact info about each team member. This project streamlines the process.
> I learned how to use Node.js in a new way to capture info from various prompts and display in a page by communicating to the front end.
